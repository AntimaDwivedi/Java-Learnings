JAVA is totally an object-oriented language and to run  a simple main method we need a class.
Without a class we can not run anything.Program's execution always start with main method in java.

By default, whenever you create a class, a default constructor will be injected by Java if there is no constructor defined by the user.
This default constructor which actually give a default value to these instance variable.



### Thumb-rule for constructor
Java says either you do it or I will do it.
