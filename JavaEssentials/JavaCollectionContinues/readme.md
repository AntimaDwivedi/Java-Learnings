##### Hash Set
###### Hashset doesn't guarantee any order.
###### Allows one null key.
###### Fastest for common operations e.g. add,search and remove.

##### LinkedHashSet
###### LinkedHashSet keep elements in the order they are added.
###### Allows one null key.
###### It's close second.

##### TreeSet
###### TreeSet sorts all object.
###### Doesn't allow null keys.
###### TreeSet is much slower ,because it needs to perform sorting.

##### Queue
###### It is a FIFO data structure. Thus, element addition does happen from the rear and removal from the front.
##### Types of Queue
###### Array backed queue
###### LinkedList backed queue
###### Blocking queue  --> null values are not allowed.

##### From above doc ,read the summary of queue methods .Insert,remove and element throws exception while offer,peek and polls return special value.

###### Dequeue is a linear collection that supports element insertion and removal at both ends.
