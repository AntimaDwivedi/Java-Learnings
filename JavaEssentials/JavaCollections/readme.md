##### Java proposed a solution to the problem of static memory allocation in form of "ArrayList"


##### With an ArrayList we can --
###### Add new values
###### delete old value
###### Increase size
###### Decrease size

###### ArrayList is a collection of similar type of entities ,with an advantage of Dynamic memory Allocation.
###### Primitive data types are not allowed in ArrayList.We have to use wrapper class such as Integer.We can make our own wrapper class too.
