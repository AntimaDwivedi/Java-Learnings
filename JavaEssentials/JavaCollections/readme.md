#### ArrayList

##### Java proposed a solution to the problem of static memory allocation in form of "ArrayList"


##### With an ArrayList we can --
###### Add new values
###### delete old value
###### Increase size
###### Decrease size

###### ArrayList is a collection of similar type of entities ,with an advantage of Dynamic memory Allocation.
###### Primitive data types are not allowed in ArrayList.We have to use wrapper class such as Integer.We can make our own wrapper class too.

##### Pros of ArrayList
###### Fast
###### Easy to access any element from any location

##### Cons of ArrayList
###### Operations are slow
###### Tend to use more memory while operating


### Stack
##### The Stack class represents a last-in-first-out(LIFO) stack of objects.
##### It extends class Vector.
##### Vector is similar to ArrayList , Difference being Vector methods are synchronized, whereas ArrayList methods are not.

##### CompareTo Method(compares on the basis of natural ordering)
###### If Part1 and part2 are same ,result is zero.
###### If part1 is greater than part2 ,result is +ve.
###### If part2 is greater than part1 ,result is -ve.
